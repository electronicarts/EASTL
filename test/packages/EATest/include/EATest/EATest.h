/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Example Usage #1
//
// This is for very simple one-off test functions that don't need or

//     }
// 
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Example Usage #2
//
// This is a more fancy example which uses the Test class to run a test.
//     class MathTest : public Test
//     {
//         int Run()
//         {

//         }
//     };
//
//     MathTest mathTest("Test via MathTest class");
//     mathTest.Run();
// 
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Example Usage #3
//
// This is the most fancy you can get, as it uses a TestSuite.
//     MathTest   mathTest;
//     StringTest stringTest;
//     TestSuite  testSuite("Test suite");
